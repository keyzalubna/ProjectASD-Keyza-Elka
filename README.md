**About Program**
Our program is a console-based Medicine Stock Management System built using the C++ programming language. Its primary purpose is to help users manage an inventory of medicines efficiently, where each medicine has a name and a stock quantity. To organize and maintain the data, the program uses a Binary Search Tree (BST), which allows for efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and updating.
**Features**
> adding a new medicine,
> searching for an existing medicine,
> updating the stock of a medicine,
> deleting a medicine,
> displaying the entire stock list, and
> exiting the program.
