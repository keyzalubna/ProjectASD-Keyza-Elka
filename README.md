**About Program** 
<p align="justify"> Our program is a console-based Medicine Stock Management System built using the C++ programming language. Its primary purpose is to help users manage an inventory of medicines efficiently, where each medicine has a name and a stock quantity. To organize and maintain the data, the program uses a Binary Search Tree (BST), which allows for efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and updating. </p>  
<p align="justify"> When a user adds a medicine, the program places it into the BST based on its name in alphabetical order. If a user tries to add a medicine that already exists, the system alerts them to avoid duplication. Searching allows users to quickly find the stock level of a specific medicine. If the user needs to change stock values—for instance, after restocking or selling—an update option is available. Medicines that are no longer needed can be deleted, with the program ensuring the BST remains structurally sound after removal. The option to view all medicines prints the inventory in alphabetical order using  in-order traversal of the BST. </p>
<p align="justify"> To make the system more reliable and user-friendly, it includes input validation for numerical entries, error handling against invalid operations, and case-insensitive handling of medicine names. Hence the program provides a structured and practical solution for basic stock management in a small clinic or pharmacy. </p>
